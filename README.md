# multi-tier-web-app-provisioning
This project automates the provisioning and deployment of a multi-tier web application stack using various technologies such as MySQL, Memcached, RabbitMQ, Apache Tomcat, and Nginx. The infrastructure setup is designed for CentOS/RHEL-based systems, leveraging shell scripts to streamline the deployment process.

**Highlights:**
- Automated the entire setup process using shell scripts, ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments.
- Configured each component to work together seamlessly, providing a scalable and efficient environment for web applications.
- Demonstrated proficiency in managing and automating infrastructure using industry-standard tools and best practices.

**Outcome:**
This project provided valuable experience in DevOps practices, particularly in automating the deployment and configuration of complex multi-tier environments. The automated setup is ideal for development, testing, and demonstration purposes, showcasing a practical application of various open-source technologies.

**Key Technologies:**
- **Vagrant:** To manage the virtual environment and automate the setup process.
- **Apache Tomcat:** Served as the application server for deploying Java web applications.
- **Nginx:** Configured as a reverse proxy and load balancer to optimize traffic distribution.
- **RabbitMQ:** Integrated as a message broker for handling asynchronous communication.
- **MySQL/MariaDB:** Deployed as the database server with secured access and initial data setup.
- **Memcached:** Implemented for caching to improve the performance of the database queries.
